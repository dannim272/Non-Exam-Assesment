### Problems & Target Audience 
- **Problems**
	- In 21st century more people are getting involved in trading of financial assets - Crypto, Stocks, Forex etc. -, however for most of them this may be hard and confusing thus leaving them miserable and with little to no capital after few months. The main problems they may face include, but aren't limited to: capital management, trading strategies, general knowledge of market behaviours, knowledge of how to trade in certain market conditions, knowledge of specific characteristics to look for in a stock, etc. 
	- **Problems looked at in-depth:**
		- **Capital management (how much money is in the account)** - how much leverage to trade with at any given time, how much capital to risk per trade, how much capital to risk simultaneously over several positions (e.g. risk of £5 on Apple and £3 on Microsoft = £8 of risk over 2 positions). How to setup "Take Profit - **TP**" & "Stop Loss - **SL**" cover positions.
			- ==**!!!Important to note!!!:** risk over positions means how much a trader is willing to lose. As given in the example £8 risk means that over the two positions traders is only willing to go down £8, however amount of money in the position will depend on how much in terms of **"%"** is the trader willing to go down. If it is 50% then overall there is going to be £16 in that trade. if only 25% that means that position could be worth £32.==
			- **Leverage** - Many inexperienced traders go into trading markets (whether thats FOREX, Crypto or stocks) like into a casino. Most will be wanting high returns quickly thus driving them to use high leverages and breaking their bank. It is important for them to manage their capital and trade it without invoking leverage. This is why many professional traders (and even some Brokers) say that you shouldn't day trade with anything less than £25,000. 
		- **Trading Strategies**
			- **Momentum Trading** - seek to profit from buying stocks that are moving in an uptrend and selling stocks moving in a downtrend.
			- **Mean Reversion** - based on the concept of mean reversion; this stems from the concept that stocks which deviate from their historic mean price will tend to revert back over a period of time to their mean value.
			- **Time-frame** 
				- **Scalping** - The trading wherein the trader “scalps” a small profit from each trade ==by exploiting the bid-ask spread== by darting in and out of a stock or other asset classes, multiple times a day to reap a small profit on each trade to add up to the big dough at the end of the day.
				- **Day Trading** - It is the act of buying and selling a financial instrument within the same trading day, or even multiple times over the course of a day, ==taking advantage of small price moves==, such that all positions are closed before the market closes for the trading day.
				- **Swing Trading** - Swing trading is a type of trading style wherein short-term strategies are played in the most liquid stocks or indices to ==take advantage of price swings==, either reverting back to the median or fading a rally and last from one day to a few days to a few weeks.
				- **Positional Trading** - As opposed to swing trading, the length of the trades is much larger for positional trading. Positional trading consists of trades lasting from a few weeks to a few months and sometimes a few years as well. Positional trading is as ==close to long term investing== as trading gets.
			- **Based on analysis technique** 
				- **Technical Trading (used more commonly by amateur traders)** - Trading obsessed with charts and graphs, monitoring lines on stock or index graphs for signs of convergence or divergence that might indicate buy or sell signals.
				- **Fundamental Trading (used by financial inst's)** - Trading based on fundamental analysis, which examines things like corporate events such as actual or anticipated earnings reports, stock splits, reorganisations or acquisitions.
				- **Techno-Fundamental Trading** - Trading based on both the technical and fundamental analysis is techno fundamental trading.
			- **Based on asset class** 
				- **Equity Trading** - Equity trading is the buying and selling of company shares or stocks​, also known as equities, on the financial market.
				- **Derivative Trading** - As suggested by the name, derivatives are contracts that derive their value from an underlying asset. The underlying asset can be stocks, currencies, indices, etc; it lets a trader take much larger speculative bets and is therefore a lot riskier than equity trading.
				- **Currency Trading** - Currency trading or Forex trading refers to the process of buying and selling currency pairs. Currencies are usually traded in pairs, e.g. GBP/USD
				- **Commodity Trading** - Similar to equity and currency, commodities are widely traded assets. Commodities that are traded are typically sorted into four broad categories: metal, energy, agricultural and livestock and meat.
				- **Crypto Trading** - Crypto trading or cryptocurrency trading refers to the process of speculating the future price movement of cryptocurrencies in an attempt to profit.
		- **Market behaviours** - If the market is volatile (often, fast and large moves of price) or no; if the market is liquid (can be bought or sold in large volumes without affecting price too much) or not; if the market is in uptrend, downtrend or consolidation in the last year or more. 
		- **Trading in certain market conditions** - which trading strategies to apply to which market behaviours, as well as which strategies to never use with which markets. 
		- **Characteristics to look for in a stock** - volatile, liquid, actively traded (stocks with largest volume), hottest (stocks with highest gain in price), IPOs (Initial Public Offering), etc.
		- **Emotions** - it can be very easy to cut your winning low (% wise) thus now maximising their potential just because you want to secure the trade on that colour green, it can also be very easy to chase yourself out of funds because you think that the trade can still return from -%50 and go into even mere %0.1. Emotions are on of the biggest threats to inexperienced traders, cutting them short will ensure that trades / strategies can play out as they're ought to. 
	- **Problems analyse** - now that we've looked at those problems in depth we need to analyse each one, and decide which will be the ones we want to solve. 
		- **Capital Management** - very easy and manageable, will simply need to create a function that takes in price level (price at which we want to buy, and no '@market' won't be allowed), qty of shares and how much one is willing to lose (whether that's in £ or in %), this then will be used to calculate TP and SL. 
		- **Trading Strategies** - considering the fact that there are a lot different strategies and at least 3 criterion for them (time-frame, technique analysis, asset class etc.), it would be extremely difficult to create an algorithm / bot for even half of them, so I'm going to be looking at the most basic ones as well as something called "pattern boosters"
		- **Market Behaviours** - these include general trends, volatility of the markets, unusual volumes (whether that's high or low) as well as price gaps.
			- general trends - **bullish** - going up, **bearish** - going down
			- **volatility** - how fast does it go up and down
			- **price gaps** - this is caused when a price of a slow moving (aka. low volatility) and low priced stock is getting skipped. This is rare during most of the day, however relatively common in the first 30min-1hr of the day and in the premarkets. 
		- **Trading in certain market conditions** - some professional say the beginners should stay away from highly volatile markets due to their inexperience, some say they should stay away from markets with low volatility because they're not going to get the experience necessary to be able to trade in the markets with high volatile. I'm going to be keeping both of these in mind, thus guiding the trader to use "mid" volatility markets. 
		- **Characteristics to look for in a stock** - these characteristics can be predefined in a market screener meaning that this tool has already been created. 
- **Evaluation** - overall I think that all of this could be implemented, of course some at higher degree then others, but if all of them were implemented this would come out to be a pretty good tool for beginner traders. This is true because it wouldn't guide them towards usage of indicators that will create "Pasta" (This is in reference to the fact that most of the indicators are line drawn on the graphs), but instead will encourage them to use their eyes and analysis skills. 
- **Target Audience** 
	- For this project I'm primarily going to be looking at "noob" and beginner traders; these traders know about the existence of financial markets, however are more likely go be looking at correlations of Fibonacci theorems with lines and the graphs and just looking at thousands of indications telling them one minute to sell the next to buy. My project should teach them the old style of trading where you would like at the chart and utilise two of the greatest indicators - price and volume. 

### Library & Main - Code
- **Library**
	- For the library code I would be looking to use C, since I will be able to diversify - and potentially speed up - the program, and for the GUI and API requests I would use Python.
- **Main**
	- C is going to be used for all the functions and calculations (predicting what's going to happen the stock next), and Python would be used for creating of the GUI and APIs as mentioned earlier. There are two reason for this approach, one is to show the ability of programmer to dual-use languages when approaching problems. Second reason, is the fact that Python presents a reasonably good selection for GUI libraries such as Tkinter, PyQT/PySide, Kivy, wxPython and Dear PyGui, as well as GTK which is native to both python and C meaning that it would make coding in both much easier. Below is the list of all the pros and cons for each library as well as their evaluations and selective choice of one of the libraries. 
	- **Tkinter** 
		- Pros
			- Comes bundled with Python, so no additional install is required .
			- Simple and easy to get started with.
			- Cross-platform (works on Windows, macOS and Linux)
		- Cons
			- Limited in terms of advanced features and modern GUI aesthetics.
		- Visual
			- Basic Program
				- ![[Pasted image 20240615222414.png]]
			- Medium Complexity Program
				- ![[Pasted image 20240615223556.png]]
		- Evaluation
			- Overall not a bad library however a very limited and simple design thus making this relatively an unattractive (subjectively) interface. I have used this library in my project and know it won't look good for this project due to its further complexity
		- Decision - **Rejected**
	- **PyQT or PySide**
		- Pros
			- Powerful and feature-rich, suitable for complex applications.
			- Supports modern GUI design with advanced widgets and functionalities.
			- Excellent documentation and a large community.
		- Cons
			- Steeper learning curve
		- Visual
			- Basic Program
				- ![[Pasted image 20240615222746.png]]
			- Medium Complexity
				- ![[Pasted image 20240615224013.png]]
		- Evaluation
			- Both Basic and Medium Complexity Programs look rather boring and relatively simple, thus pushing me away from using this library for this project. 
		- Decision - **Rejected** 
	- **Kivy**
		- Pros
			- Designed for multi-touch applications
			- Cross-platform (supports Windows, macOS, Linux, Android and iOS)
			- Suitable for both desktop and mobile applications
		- Cons
			- Different programming paradigm (e.g., uses its own language for layouts)
			- Can be complex for simple applications.
		- Visual
			- Basic Program
				- ![[Pasted image 20240615222910.png]]
			- Medium Complexity Program
				- ![[Pasted image 20240615224406.png]]
		- Evaluation
			- Both Programs look interesting although the medium complexity version looks rather boring and simple. 
		- Decision - **Rejected** 
	- **wxPython**
		- Pros
			- Native look and feel on different operating systems
			- Rich set of widgets
			- Good balance between ease of use and feature set
		- Cons
			- Not as widely used as Tkinter or PyQt
			- Larger binary sizes for distributions
		- Visual
			- Basic Program
				- ![[Pasted image 20240615223051.png]]
			- Medium Complexity
				- ![[Pasted image 20240615225007.png]]
		- Evaluation
			- Both programs - again - look rather very simple which isn't something I'm looking for to be in my program. 
		- Decision - **Rejected**
	- **Dear PyGui**
		- Pros
			- Fast and responsive
			- Modern and visually appealing
			- Designed for game-like interfaces and applications requiring high performance
		- Cons
			- Less traditional approach compared to other libraries
			- Not as extensive in terms of widget variety
		- Visual
			- Basic Program
				- ![[Pasted image 20240615223219.png]]
			- Medium Complexity Program
				- ![[Pasted image 20240615225336.png]]
		- Evaluation
			- Overall the program looks extremely appealing because its design is similar to old style finance apps such as Interactive Broker or TradeStation, it also looks kind of similar to Bloomberg Terminal. Furthermore the window (blue bar with text "Task Manager") could be used for different things such as charts, ticker entrance field or even 2D volume graph
		- 2nd Evaluation 
			- too much trouble with setting up of virtual envs - this is due to library undergoing constant modifications
		- Decision - **Rejected**
